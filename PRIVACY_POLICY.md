## 1. Data We Collect

### 1.1 Anonymous Usage Analytics

We use PostHog, a privacy-focused analytics platform, to understand how the Extension is used. When you use the Extension, we collect:

| Data Type | Example | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Page URL | `rightmove.co.uk/properties/123456` | Understand which property pages the Extension runs on |
| Site hostname | `rightmove.co.uk` | Track which supported sites are most used |
| Event type | `prediction_completed` | Measure feature usage and success rates |
| Property details | Bedrooms: 2, Postcode: SW3 | Improve prediction accuracy |
| Session identifier | `sess_abc123` | Group events within a browsing session |
| Extension version | `1.0.0` | Identify issues with specific versions |

**Events we track:**
- Extension loaded on a property page
- Prediction successfully generated
- Prediction failed (with error category)
- Floorplan OCR initiated/completed/failed
- Similar properties loaded
- Compare page opened

### 1.2 Data Stored Locally on Your Device

We store only one piece of data locally using Chrome's storage API:

| Data | Format | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Anonymous ID | `rfv_xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` | Distinguish unique installations for analytics aggregation |

This identifier is:
- A randomly generated UUID (not linked to you personally)
- Never shared with property websites
- Stored only on your device
- Deletable by uninstalling the Extension

### 1.3 Property Data Processed

When you view a rental listing, the Extension extracts property information **directly from the page you're viewing**:

- Asking rent (price)
- Property address and postcode
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Property size (square footage)
- Property type (flat, house, etc.)
- Listed amenities
- Floorplan images (for OCR extraction)

**Important:** This property data is:
- Processed locally in your browser
- NOT stored by us
- NOT transmitted to our servers (except anonymized summaries in analytics)
- Only used to generate your rent estimate
